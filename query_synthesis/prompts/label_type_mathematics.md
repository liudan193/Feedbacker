You are tasked with categorizing a given query into multiple tags based on the following hierarchical classification system. 

### Classification System:
```markdown
The first level of the following classification system is the basis for classification, the second level is specific categories, and the third level is more specific subcategories.

Classification Basis 1: Mathematical Subfields  
1. "Mathematical Foundations": "Logic", "Arithmetic", "Set Theory", "Number Systems", "Category Theory", "History of Mathematics"  
2. "Discrete Mathematics": "Graph Theory", "Combinatorics", "Game Theory", "Automata Theory"  
3. "Applied Mathematics": "Physics", "Signals", "Games", "Operations Research", "Economics"  
4. "Algebra": "Linear Algebra", "Abstract Algebra", "Boolean Algebra", "Algebraic Geometry", "Group Theory"  
5. "Geometry": "Differential Geometry", "Coordinate Geometry", "Topology", "Crystallography"  
6. "Analysis": "Algebra", "Mathematical Analysis", "Real Analysis", "Complex Analysis", "Functional Analysis", "Fourier Analysis", "Limits", "Calculus"  
7. "Probability and Statistics"  
8. "Number Theory"  
9. "Information Theory"  
10. "Computational Mathematics"  

Classification Basis 2: Task Types  
1. "Fact Recall"  
2. "Conceptual Understanding"  
3. "Computation"  
4. "Problem Solving": "Modeling", "Creative Problem Solving", "Practical Application", "Word Problems", "Scenario Analysis"  
5. "Logical Reasoning": "Logical Deduction", "Puzzle Solving", "Theoretical Derivation", "Critical Review"  
6. "Visualization": "Geometric Drawing", "Function Graphing", "Data Visualization"  
```

### Rules for Tagging:
1. **Hierarchy Rule**: If a query matches both a parent node and its child nodes, include both in the tags.
2. **Multiple Matches**: If a query matches multiple nodes at the same level, include all matching nodes.
3. **No Match**: If a query does not match any nodes under the second-level main categories, assign the tag "Other" to that category.
4. **Output Format**: The final output must be enclosed within `<tags>` and `</tags>` tags, and the tags should be provided as a JSON object where the keys are the basis for classification and the values are lists of matching tags.

### Example:
Query: "How do I use calculus to model the growth of a population over time and graph the results?"
Output: <tags>{{"Mathematical Subfields": ["Analysis", "Calculus", "Applied Mathematics"], "Task Types": ["Problem Solving", "Modeling", "Visualization", "Function Graphing"]}}</tags>

### Now, analyze the following query:  
<|begin_of_query|>  
{query}  
<|end_of_query|>
