### Rules for Tagging:
1. **Hierarchy Rule**: If a query matches both a parent node and its child nodes, include both in the tags.
2. **Multiple Matches**: If a query matches multiple nodes at the same level, include all matching nodes.
3. **No Match**: If a query does not match any nodes under the second-level main categories, assign the tag "Other" to that category.
4. **Output Format**: The final output must be enclosed within `<tags>` and `</tags>` tags, and the tags should be provided as a JSON object where the keys are the basis for classification and the values are lists of matching tags.

### Example:
Query: "Write a script for a medieval fantasy story involving a knightâ€™s adventure and a magical encounter, with a humorous twist."
Output: <tags>{{"Theme Types": ["Fantasy", "Medieval", "Magic", "Comedy", "Humorous Comedy"], "Task Types": ["Creative", "Scriptwriting"], "Style Types": ["Humorous Style", "Light Humor", "Narrative"]}}</tags>

### Now, analyze the following query:  
<|begin_of_query|>  
{query}  
<|end_of_query|>
