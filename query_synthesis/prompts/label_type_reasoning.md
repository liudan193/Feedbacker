You are tasked with categorizing a given query into multiple tags based on the following hierarchical classification system. 

### Classification System:
```markdown
The first level of the following classification system is the basis for classification, the second level is specific categories, and the third level is more specific subcategories.

Classification Basis 1: Reasoning Methods  
1. "Logical Reasoning": "Deductive Reasoning", "Inductive Reasoning", "Symbolic Reasoning", "Basic Counting Reasoning"  
2. "Causal Reasoning": "Multi-factor Attribution", "Direct Causal Chain", "Bayesian Reasoning"  
3. "Analogical Reasoning"  
4. "Spatial Reasoning": "Geometric Relationships", "Topological Relationships"  
5. "Speculative Reasoning"  
6. "Classification Reasoning"  
7. "Critical Reasoning"  
8. "Explanatory Reasoning"  
9. "Comparative Reasoning"  
10. "Analytical Reasoning"  
11. "Emotional Reasoning"  

Classification Basis 2: Application Domains  
1. "Legal Reasoning"  
2. "Ethical Reasoning"  
3. "Mathematical Reasoning"  
4. "Philosophical Reasoning"  
5. "Biological Reasoning"  
6. "Psychological Reasoning"  
7. "Social Reasoning"  
8. "Negotiation"  
9. "Organization"  
10. "Strategic Planning"  
11. "Personal Development Guidance"  

Classification Basis 3: Thinking Modes  
1. "Analytical": "System Deconstruction", "Pattern Recognition", "Text Analysis"  
2. "Creative": "Divergent Association", "Concept Reorganization", "Abstract Reasoning", "Creative Exploration", "Conceptual Thinking"  
3. "Critical"  
4. "Strategic"  
5. "Hypothetical Thinking"  

Classification Basis 4: Task Types  
1. "Argumentation"  
2. "Evaluation"  
3. "Design"  
4. "Theory"  
5. "Reasoning"  
6. "Puzzle Solving"  
7. "Decision Making"  
8. "Conceptual Understanding"  
9. "Situational Analysis"  
10. "Evaluation and Feedback"  
11. "Problem Solving": "Creative", "Experimental"  
```

### Rules for Tagging:
1. **Hierarchy Rule**: If a query matches both a parent node and its child nodes, include both in the tags.
2. **Multiple Matches**: If a query matches multiple nodes at the same level, include all matching nodes.
3. **No Match**: If a query does not match any nodes under the second-level main categories, assign the tag "Other" to that category.
4. **Output Format**: The final output must be enclosed within `<tags>` and `</tags>` tags, and the tags should be provided as a JSON object where the keys are the basis for classification and the values are lists of matching tags.

### Example:
Query: "How can I determine the cause of an event based on multiple contributing factors?"  
Output: <tags>{{"Reasoning Methods": ["Multi-factor Attribution"], "Application Domains": ["Other"], "Thinking Modes": ["Analytical"], "Task Types": ["Reasoning"]}}</tags>

### Now, analyze the following query:  
<|begin_of_query|>  
{query}  
<|end_of_query|>
