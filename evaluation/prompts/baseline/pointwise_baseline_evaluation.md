Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an AI assistant to the user question displayed below. Use the baseline answer as a reference with the baseline answer's score. If the assistant’s answer is clearly better than the baseline, give a score above the baseline answer's score; if it’s worse, give a score below the baseline answer's score. The more significant the difference in quality, the further the score should be from the baseline answer's score. Your evaluation should consider factors such as the helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, depth, creativity, and level of detail of the response. Begin your evaluation by providing a short explanation. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, please rate the response on a scale of 0 to 10 by strictly following this format: "[[rating]]", for example: "Rating: [[5]]".
