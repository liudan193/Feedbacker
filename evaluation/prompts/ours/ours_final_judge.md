Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an AI assistant to the user question displayed below. Your evaluation should consider the evaluation system displayed below. Begin your evaluation by providing an explanation for each metric, assessing the response objectively. Score each metric on a scale of 1 to 3, where 1 represents complete failure to meet the criterion and 3 represents perfection. The weights of the metrics must sum to 100, and the final weighted score should be calculated on a scale up to 300, reflecting the weighted sum of the individual scores. After evaluation, you must summarize the results within <The Start of Evaluation Result> and <The End of Evaluation Result>. Below is an example output:
<The Start of Evaluation Result>
Metric 1 | score: [2]
Metric 2 | score: [3]
Metric 3 | score: [1]
...

Final Weighted Score: [[200]]
<The End of Evaluation Result>
